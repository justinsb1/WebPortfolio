            My senior design project involved me and four other classmates where we had to create a mobile application and deploy it to the app store.  The purpose of the app was to allow users to post tasks they need completed and broadcast these tasks to users who are willing to complete the tasks.  The role that I played in developing this app was majority of the front end development.  The framework of the app was done using Ionic Framework which is an open source library for mobile-optimized components in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.  I coded the JavaScript and designed the details of each pagesâ€™ CSS.  I also created and designed the app logo and splash screen using Adobe Illustrator CC.  I created these and implemented them using Ionic Framework. Attached below is a link to view video tutorials on using the features of the app.

This application was done with the following technologies: JavaScript(EJS), HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, and Bootstrap. The backend was done using MongoDB. Below are links to my GitHub code for the project as well as the deployed application.

            Expensify is a web application that I made using an online bootcamp course from Udemy.com.  Users must login into Expensify from the homepage using their Google account in order to use the app.   Once a user is logged in, they can then create and budget their expenses.  The user can keep track of expenses within a range of dates by using the calendar feature. The user can also order their expenses by date or amount. The user may also search for any expense.  This application was done with the following technologies: React.js, HTML5, SCSS, React-Router, and Redux. The backend was done using Firebase.  Below are links to my Github code for the project as well as the deployed application.
